# Cloudlog

Cloudlog is a self-hosted PHP application, which allows you to log your amateur radio contacts anywhere all you need is a web browser and active internet connection.

## Versions

* Master - Current working copy

## Setup

You can setup the basics of Cloudlog by opening /install in your browser, however please note theres an issue with the demo account creation (passwords invalid) so after this process you must disable auth via the config.php file and manually create yourself a user till this issue is fixed.

More information can be found in the wiki.

## CAT Control

Its possible to interact with your radio if you have a K3, FT-950 or a ICOM radio using a nice application that Rob (M0VFC) has put together called [CloudlogCAT](https://github.com/rmc47/CloudlogCAT). The application is still in active development and lots of new features are due.
